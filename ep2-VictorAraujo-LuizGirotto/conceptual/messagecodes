Messages are made up of three-digit codes. Let us define a generic code as "xyz".

x represents the sender of the message.
	> 0 = immortal
	> 1 = leader
	> 2 = worker

y and z represent the contents of the message. Messages are sender-sensite, which means that the meaning of the "yz" part of the message can change
depending on the x part of the message.
The following is a list of all messages available on this system:

000, 100, 200 - OK
011, 111, 211 - NOT OK

001 - Sent to newly promoted worker (turned into leader)
002 - Sent to newly demoted leader (turned into simple worker)
003 - Sent to check if process is alive

102 - Work request

210 - Working
212 - Work done
